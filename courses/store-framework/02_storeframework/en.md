# Store Framework 101

>Before getting down to business there are some important, frequently occurring concepts you need to familiarize yourself with. 

## Introduction 

Store Framework is a *commerce low-code* tool used for building unique and custom storefronts.

The building flow starts with a custom **theme**, which can be worked on in different **workspaces**, without impacting the production environment.  

## Theme 

A theme is essentially an **arrangement of blocks** and their position. In a theme, you can define every customization, position and style for every block that theme encompasses. You can also declare new pages in a theme, pages that in the future may represent **about us** or promotional **landing** pages (such as mother's day, black Friday, cyber Monday pages). The theme's end result consists of the content it's comprised of, in addition to the storefront.

## Blocks

Blocks are the minimal abstraction in Store Framework. They declare small pieces that make up a store's layout. Although they may look simple at first, blocks are imbued with a high customization power, allowing us to achieve complex designs. There are a total of **four block customization levels**: 
- **semantic style *(styles)***;
- **properties *(props)***;
- **css classes *(handles)***;
- **children *(children)***

## Workspaces

Secure work environments that show a very close copy of what is running in production, allowing themes to be developed further without affecting the store.
