## Objective

It's important to establish that is not an expository course. Its objective is to teach participants about the VTEX IO Store Framework based on practical applications/activities. Therefore, in order to advance, you'll need to invest some time and dedication into it.

At the beginning of the course, you'll receive a repository containing a minimum amount of code our wish is that, upon completing all the tasks laid before you, you would have transformed that code into a **fully functional store**.

## Intro

The course is divided into chapters. As each chapter begins, you'll receive initial instructions, just as you've already received for this and previous chapters. You should read through all of the presented content and perform the minor task set out at the end of the chapter.

For your answers to be sent, follow these steps:

1. Open a new window in VSCode
2. Execute CTRL + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P
3. Run `git clone`

## Don't forget to link

Anytime you open the VSCode terminal, you can run a `vtex link` to monitor the evolution of your project in  `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com`. Make sure that the solution is **visually comparable to what was presented** and that **no link errors occurred**.
