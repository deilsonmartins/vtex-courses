# Installing an app on VTEX IO 

## Introduction
Once you publish an app, you can install it on a VTEX account. Generally, after installing it, there is a robot, called House Keeper, that makes sure all the VTEX accounts have the installed apps kept up to date. Minor and patches version that are launched are automatically updated on all the accounts.

However, for installing an app for the first time or a major update, it needs to be done manually. In this step, you'll learn how to do that.
