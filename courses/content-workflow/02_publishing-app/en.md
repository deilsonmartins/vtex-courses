# Publishing an app on VTEX IO

## Introduction
After being presented to the concepts regarding the types of workspaces, we're going to teach how to publish an app on VTEX IO. In order to realize operations like these, we use commands on [VTEX Toolbelt](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-documentation-toolbelt), our CLI that gives you access to the platform features.

## Using VTEX Toolbelt to publish an app

To publish an app on VTEX IO, one needs to use the following command on VTEX Toolbelt inside the app's folder:

```
vtex publish
```

When running this command, it's necessary to confirm the action.
