# Making your store unique

## Introduction
In order to introduce developers to how to build custom apps in VTEX IO, this course was launched. It goes through all the necessary steps to have a custom block in a theme that uses React, Typescript, and GraphQL.

## About this course
This course will guide you through learning how to develop a custom app with VTEX IO. At the end of it, you will have a fully functional app, which is a countdown block for your store.

There are some prerequisities for you to have an amazing experience when doing this tutorial, which are:

- Knowledge on React and how to use hooks
- Basic concepts on GraphQL
- Understand how to develop using Typescript

If you are not familiar with any of those tools, we encourage you to take a look in some documentation:
- [**React.js**](https://reactjs.org/)
- [**React Hook API**](https:/**/reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [**Typescript documentation**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

In order for you to start the course, you can use the template repository that we provide will all the initial files that you need to have so you can get started. You will find the repository in this [link](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/store-block-template).

### How to use a template repository?

It's possible to create a new repository from a template. This option is easier than cloning the repository, because it avoids problems with the `.git` files.

Using the template, you can create a new one with the name that you want, based on the available template. To do so, you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to the template repository that you want to use:

2. Click on the green button **Use this template**:

> You can also choose if the repository is going to be **public** or **private** and provide a description.

> After doing those steps, you can clone the repository that you've just created.
