## Building stores using Store Framework

This course will show you how to use Store Framework, a storefront low-code commerce development tool, designed to build a functional VTEX store's theme from scratch. Store Framework speeds theme creation by reusing visual blocks present in most stores without requiring any additional development. The blocks, however, do not provide a repetitive visual that would make stores very alike, but instead provide ample opportunity for customization through CSS properties and styling.

Learn to use Store Framework and be more productive than ever before in building and maintaining VTEX stores.
